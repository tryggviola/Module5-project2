# Module5-project2

In this project we learned all about the wonders of DNS which is really helpful to understand how the internet works. 

I had a little bit of a trouble wrapping my head around the article that we were asked to read (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-learning-and-using-dns-records--cms-24704) so I started googling and came across a couple of videos that really helped me out.

I went to 1984.is and created an account and messed about a bit. The progress was a little bit confusing still for me so I went back to the original article and read through that in addition to these here:

https://techgenix.com/know-about-dns/
https://www.nexcess.net/blog/dns-records-everything-you-need-to-know/

I sorta got the point of it and everything that is related to it but I am still going to try to learn some more about it.
